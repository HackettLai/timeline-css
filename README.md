This repo runs the web client in a offline mode where projects are saved to local storage.  The live site builds the client from this module.


## Running locally

Recommended node version: **v17.4.0**  
Recommended npm version:  **v8.3.1**

- Run dev server `npm i && npm start`
- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Create a project by clicking "Sandbox" button in top right of landing page

In it's current state, only one project can be saved & updated at a time when running locally.
To test more complex projects, copy projects from the live site.
